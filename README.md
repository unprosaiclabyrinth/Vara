# Vara DSL

Vara is a domain-specific language for simple algebraic symbolic computation implemented in Scala. Why is this powerful? Consider the following problem: a farmer wants to come up with a [closed-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression) formula that computes an hour's total milk yield $$M$$, given the number of dairy cows $$C$$, the average feed-quality index $$Q$$ (1 - 5 scale), and the average daytime temperature $$T$$ (˚F). A friend of hers has come up with a heavy computational routine that exactly computes $$M(C, Q, T)$$, but only runs on a computer. This algorithm would easily time out on the barn's lightweight controller, and it's logistically inconvenient to contact the friend every hour for the answer. The farmer desperately needs a closed-form in terms of $$C$$, $$Q$$, and $$T$$ so that she can plug numbers on her pocket calculator, or compute it by hand. All her friend can tell her are the exact values for $$M(50, 4, 83)$$, $$M(100, 3, 72)$$, and so on but not a closed-form for $$M(C, Q, T)$$. If only the computation could be done symbolically...

This is where Vara comes in! Suppose the implementation of the complex algorithm looks like:
```scala
def milkYield(numCows: Int, quality: Int, temp: Double): Double = {
  // long, complex computation
}

val M = milkYield(50, 4, 83)
println(M) // prints a value e.g. 54.21
```

This can be tweaked using Vara (note the `import` statements) to look like:
```scala
import org.vara.Variable
import org.vara.VaraExpr
import org.vara.VaraExpr.*

def milkYield(numCows: VaraExpr, quality: VaraExpr, temp: VaraExpr): VaraExpr = {
  // long, complex computation tweaked for VaraExprs
}

val M = milkYield("C", "Q", "T")
println(M) // prints out a closed-form expression e.g. \frac{CQ}{T^2}!
```
The closed-form expression is in LaTeX syntax so that it can be easily interpreted or copy-pasted into a tool like [QuickLatex](https://www.quicklatex.com/) to make it human-readable.

## Syntax and Semantics

Vara allows manipulating symbolic expressions and using them as first-class values. Every construct you build is represented uniformly as an instance of some subtype of the expression supertype in Vara: **`VaraExpr`**, be it a constant, a variable, a sum, a product, or a more exotic algebraic expression. Variables can be written simply as Strings and Vara will implicitly convert them to type `VaraExpr` given the import `org.vara.Variable`. Similarly, Vara implicitly converts constants of supertypes Int or Double to `VaraExpr` given the import `org.vara.VaraExpr.*`. This way, Vara strives to provide natural readability of symbolic expressions. The following are valid expressions in Vara:
```scala
val variable: VaraExpr = "x"
val constant: VaraExpr = 3
val validExpression: VaraExpr = 3.14
val anotherValidExpression: VaraExpr = "pi"
```

### Operations

Variables and constants are the building blocks of all expressions in Vara, and they can be combined using operators that represent different operations. Vara supports a few but integral simple algebraic operations, which along with their operator syntax are:

|      Operation | Vara syntax | Examples                                 |
|---------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------------------------------|
|       Addition |    `+#`     | `"a" +# 3`, `"x" +# "y" +# "z"`          |
|    Subtraction |    `-#`     | `4 -# 3`, `"p" -# "q"`, `0 -# "zero"`    |
| Multiplication |    `*#`     | `"var1" *# "var2" *# "var3"`, `5 *# "k"` |
|       Division |    `/#`     | `"n" /# "d"`, `"var" /# 2`               |
| Exponentiation |    `#:`     | `"r" #: "t"`, `"b" #: 2`                 |
|       Negation |     `-`     | `-"x"`, `-1`                             |

The order of precedence of these operators is the same as the standard for the corresponding numerical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, and unary `-`, where `^` has the highest precedence followed by unary `-` followed by (`*`, `/`) followed by (`+`, `-`). Similarly, the symbolic Vara operators have the same associativity as their numerical counterparts: (`+#`, `-#`, `*#`, `/#`) are left-associative, and (`#:`, `-`) are right-associative. You can control the evaluation order by wrapping sub-expressions in parentheses, ensuring they’re computed first. This is in alignment with the standard that parentheses have precedence over all operators. The operators, variables, constants, and parentheses can be used together to create complex symbolic algebraic expressions. **(FILL MEAT)** Under the hood, Vara builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) for an expression based on the order of precedence and the associativity of operators. There are some conventions that Vara follows while structuring the AST for an expression. Vara:
+ folds constants where possible. E.g. `"a" +# 3 -# 2` $$\to$$ `"a" +# 1`, and `"b" *# 8 /# 2` $$\to$$ `4 *# "b"`.
+ simplifies a sum of like algebraic terms to a product with a constant. E.g. `"x" +# "x" +# "x" -# "x"` $$\to$$ `2 *# "x"`.
+ simplifies a product of like algebraic terms to an exponent with a constant power. E.g. `"x" *# "x" *# "x" /# "x"` $$\to$$ `"x" #: 2`.
+ uses laws of indices to simplify exponents. E.g. `("a" #: "m") /# ("a" #: "n")` $$\to$$ `"a" #: ("m" +# "n")`, `("a" #: "m") #: "n"` $$\to$$ `"a" #: ("m" *# "n")`.

**(FILL MEAT)**

Along with the algebraic operations, Vara also supports two Boolean operations on symbolic expressions:

|      Operation | Vara syntax | Examples                                 |
|---------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------------------------------|
|         Equals |    `==`     | `"a" +# 0 == "a"` $$\to$$ true           |
|     Not equals |    `!=`     | `"a" +# "b" != "a" -# "b"` $$\to$$ true  |

These operators perform a **structural comparison** of two `VaraExpr` trees, returning `true` if their AST shapes are identical (`==`) or different (`!=`).
