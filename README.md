# Vara DSL

Vara is a domain-specific language for simple algebraic symbolic computation implemented in Scala. Why is this powerful? Consider the following problem: a farmer wants to come up with a closed-form formula that computes an hour's total milk yield $$M$$, given the number of dairy cows $$C$$, the average feed-quality index $$Q$$ (1 - 5 scale), and the average daytime temperature $$T$$ (ËšF). A friend of hers has come up with a heavy computational routine that exactly computes $$M(C, Q, T)$$, but only runs on a computer. This algorithm would easily time out on the barn's lightweight controller, and it's logistically inconvenient to contact the friend every hour for the answer. The farmer desperately needs a closed-form in terms of $$C$$, $$Q$$, and $$T$$ so that she can plug numbers on her pocket calculator, or compute it by hand. All her friend can tell her are the exact values for $$M(50, 4, 83)$$, $$M(100, 3, 72)$$, and so on but not a closed-form for $$M(C, Q, T)$$. If only the computation could be done symbolically...

This is where Vara comes in! Suppose the implementation of the complex algorithm looks like:
```scala
def milkYield(numCows: Int, quality: Int, temp: Double): Double = {
  // long, complex computation
}

val M = milkYield(50, 4, 83)
println(M) // prints a value e.g. 54.21
```

This can be tweaked using Vara (note the `import` statements) to look like:
```scala
import org.vara.VaraExpr
import org.vara.VaraExpr.*

def milkYield(numCows: VaraExpr, quality: VaraExpr, temp: VaraExpr): VaraExpr = {
  // long, complex computation tweaked for VaraExprs
}

val M = milkYield("C", "Q", "T")
println(M) // prints out a closed-form expression e.g. \frac{CQ}{T^2}!
```
The closed-form expression is in LaTeX syntax so that it can be easily interpreted or copy-pasted into a tool like [QuickLatex](https://www.quicklatex.com/) to make it human-readable.

## Syntax and Semantics

Vara allows manipulating symbolic expressions and using them as first-class values. Every construct you build is represented uniformly as an instance of some subtype of the expression supertype in Vara: **`VaraExpr`**, be it a constant, a variable, a sum, a product, or a more exotic algebraic expression. Variables can be written simply as Strings and Vara will implicitly convert them to type `VaraExpr`. Similarly, Vara implicitly converts constants of type Double to `VaraExpr`. The following are valid expressions in Vara:
```scala
val variable: VaraExpr = "x"
val constant: VaraExpr = 3

val validExpression: VaraExpr = 3.14
val anotherValidExpression: VaraExpr = "pi"
```

### Operations

Variables and constants are the building blocks of all expressions in Vara, and they can be combined using operators that represent different operations. Vara supports a few but integral simple algebraic operations, which along with their operator syntax are:

|      Operation | Vara syntax | Examples                                 |
|---------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------------------------------|
|       Addition |    `+#`     | `"a" +# 3`, `"x" +# "y" +# "z"`          |
|    Subtraction |    `-#`     | `4 -# 3`, `"p" -# "q"`, `0 -# "zero"`    |
| Multiplication |    `*#`     | `"var1" *# "var2" *# "var3"`, `5 *# "k"` |
|       Division |    `/#`     | `"n" /# "d"`, `"var" /# 2`               |
| Exponentiation |    `#:`     | `"r" #: "t"`, `"b" #: 2`                 |
|       Negation |     `-`     | `-"x"`, `-1`                             |

The order of precedence of these operators is the same as the standard for the corresponding numerical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, and unary `-`, where `^` has the highest precedence followed by unary `-` followed by (`*`, `/`) followed by (`+`, `-`). Similarly, the symbolic Vara operators have the same associativity as their numerical counterparts: (`+#`, `-#`, `*#`, `/#`) are left-associative, and (`#:`, `-`) are right-associative.
